## Task Execution Workflow

- Before executing any task:
  - Summarize the understanding of the request
  - Ask for confirmation if ambiguity exists
  - Provide a confidence level (0–10) for expected outcome

- Execute tasks incrementally:
  - Do not implement everything at once
  - Break tasks into small, verifiable steps

- After each execution:
  - Report what was done
  - Provide a confidence level (0–10) based on the result

- Skipping steps is not allowed
